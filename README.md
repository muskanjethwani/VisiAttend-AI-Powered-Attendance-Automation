# VisiAttend-AI-Powered-Attendance-Automation
An AI-based attendance management system that eliminates manual roll calls by using face recognition technology. Students first register with their facial data, and during attendance sessions, the system automatically identifies faces via OpenCV and Face Recognition libraries. Attendance is logged in a local SQL database with timestamps, and detailed reports can be generated instantly.
KEY FEATURES:
95%+ recognition accuracy
Real-time detection and marking
Fully replaces manual attendance processes
